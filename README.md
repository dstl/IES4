Until March 2025, this repo provided public access to the IES for collaboration purposes including the specification itself, sample data/code and supporting documentation. From March 2025, IES work is continued through the cross-government [IES Working Group](https://github.com/ies-org) where releases from 4.3.2 can be found.  The final release on this repo is 4.3.1. This repo is now archived. 

IES was developed by the UK Government with contributions from Dstl, Ministry of Defence, Metropolitan Police Service, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Home Office, Department for Business and Trade (was BEIS), and HMRC, with technical support from Aurora Consulting (to Home Office) and Telicent (to Dstl).
